Keyboard shortcuts
==================

**Where can I find the list of keyboard shortcuts?**

From within the editor go to the menu entry Help > Help.

Why only jpeg
=============

**I want to upload png! Why is only jpeg allowed?**

That is because of the exif data which can only be read from the jpeg files.

The time is behind
==================

**It is noticeable that the timestamps are shifted some hours. Why is that so?**

The times are in Universal Time (UT former GMT).

Batch add does not create elements in the database
==================================================

**When I look into the database I see no elements were created by the batch add?**

The batch add only works with fragments which are marked as "ready".
