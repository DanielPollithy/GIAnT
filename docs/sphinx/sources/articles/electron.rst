Electron for cross platform applications
----------------------------------------

Operating systems differ. Especially when it comes to writing graphical user interfaces.
That is the reason why "cross platform frameworks" exist.
They try to provide general functions that work on every major operating system.

If you want to build a desktop application you first have to decide whether you want to use a
"cross platform framework" and if so, which one?

a version of Google Chrome) with the runtime environment for Node.JS execution.
The last important thing they provide


Re-usability

Websites... etc.
