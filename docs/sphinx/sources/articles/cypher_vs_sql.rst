Cypher vs. SQL
--------------

This article shows why Cypher is superior to plain SQL for information extraction on graphs.
We are going to exercise a complete example from storing a graph to retrieving data and calculating some metrics.

Example scenario
................

Imagine someone wrote to the wall 'Lazio merda'.

.. image:: ../images/screenshots/1.png

Now another person came and erased Lazio and wrote above it 'AS ROMA'

.. image:: ../images/screenshots/2.png

And in the last step the 'merda' was erased.

.. image:: ../images/screenshots/3.png

One could suppose that these three steps were the beginning of the fragment on the left side of the following image,
which is part of Sebastian Lasch's corpus:

.. image:: ../images/screenshots/bild.png
