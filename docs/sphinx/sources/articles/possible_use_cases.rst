Possible use cases
------------------

This software was built for the special use case described in "Analyzing 3000 Graffiti"
but is should be able to serve more general purposes.

Main Question: Who could use this software?
The answer can only be given when someone decides to use GIAnT but we can speculate to whom it might
be useful.

Maybe in order to analyze book annotations:

Or to analyze movements:

Maybe in order to show developments of city centres:

If you need think about using GIAnT but don't know how to model your data please feel free to
get in touch.
